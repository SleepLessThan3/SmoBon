This project was initially just a small rpg style combat engine that I had thought of on a whim, but ended up being a bigger than I had intended for it to get. I really pushed myself to go as big as I could go, and just barely completed it within the time limit with an all nighter the night before it was due. I had a lot of fun creating the different databases for everything and connecting it all together. I didn't even actually have anything of substance outputting until yesterday night (3/18), as I had just been working on the back end for the entire time. I think the most challenging part for me was the pytest stuff, as I am used to creating a framework for everything, and then having a session of just running my files over and over with different inputs, and fixing all the bugs I could find.\n",
